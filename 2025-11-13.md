# Project Plan: Wild Block - League of Legends Champion Blocker

**Date:** 2025-11-13

## 1. Technology Stack

*   **HTML:** A single `index.html` file for the structure.
*   **CSS:** Bootstrap 5 for the main layout and components, with a custom `assets/css/style.css` for the red 'X' overlay and other specific styling.
*   **JavaScript:** Vanilla JavaScript in a `assets/js/script.js` file to handle the application logic.

## 2. Core Features & Implementation

*   **Data Fetching:** On page load, the application will fetch the full list of champions from the official Riot Games Data Dragon API.
*   **Champion Display:** The champions will be displayed in a responsive grid, showing each champion's splash portrait.
*   **Search & Autocomplete:** A search input will be powered by a lightweight autocomplete library to suggest champion names as the user types.
*   **Selection & Blocking:**
    *   Clicking a champion portrait will open a Bootstrap modal.
    *   This modal will allow the user to enter an optional reason for blocking the champion.
    *   Upon saving, a visual red 'X' will be overlaid on the champion's portrait.
*   **Persistence:** The list of blocked champions (including their names and the reasons) will be saved to the browser's `localStorage`. This ensures that the user's selections persist even after they close or refresh the page.
*   **Unblocking:** Clicking on an already-blocked champion will remove them from the saved list and update the UI.

## 3. File Structure

The following files will be created:

*   `index.html`
*   `assets/css/style.css`
*   `assets/js/script.js`
